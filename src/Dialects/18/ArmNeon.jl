`intr_smull`

Signed Multiply Long (vector). This instruction multiplies corresponding
signed integer values in the lower or upper half of the vectors of the two
source SIMD&FP registers, places the results in a vector, and writes the
vector to the destination SIMD&FP register.

`_2d_sdot`

The two input vectors `b` and `c` have a 2D shape, consisting of either 2
or 4 rows, each row having length 4. This operation computes the pair-wise
dot-products of the rows of `b` and `c` and accumulates them with the
corresponding entry of `a`:

```
res[i] := a[i] + dot_product(b[i, ...], c[i, ...])

`intr_smmla`

SMMLA: Signed integer matrix multiply-accumulate.

Signed 8-bit integer matrix multiply-accumulate. This instruction multiplies
the 2x8 matrix of signed 8-bit integer values in the first source vector by
the 8x2 matrix of signed 8-bit integer values in the second source vector.
The resulting 2x2 32-bit integer matrix product is destructively added to
the 32-bit integer matrix accumulator in the destination vector. This is
equivalent to performing an 8-way dot product per destination element.
