Returns the broadcasted shape for input shapes or extent tensors. The rest

operands are tensors, may be of type `tensor<?xindex>`.

different from each other but none is 1, the result is an error shape.

value. If the result type is an extent tensor (and can therefore not hold
the error value) the behavior may be undefined. The optional string

`reduce`

An operation that takes as input a shape or extent tensor, and a number of
initial values. This operation has a region that is applied repeatedly for
every extent of the input. Starting with the initial values, the individual

```
res[] = init;

  res = reduce(i, shape[i], res[0], ..., res[n]);

`with_shape`

Returns ValueShape with the shape updated to match the shape operand. That
is a new ValueShape tuple is created with value equal to `operand`\'s
value and shape equal to `shape`. If the ValueShape and given `shape` are
non-conformant, then the returned ValueShape will represent an error of
this mismatch. Similarly if either inputs are in an error state, then an
error is propagated.

Usage:
  %0 = shape.with_shape %1, %2 : tensor<...>, !shape.shape

This is used, for example, where one combines shape function calculations
and/or call one shape function from another. E.g.,

```mlir
func.func @shape_foobah(%a: !shape.value_shape,
                   %b: !shape.value_shape,
                   %c: !shape.value_shape) -> !shape.shape {

  %2 = call @shape_bah(%c, %1) :
    (!shape.value_shape, !shape.value_shape) -> !shape.shape
  return %2 : !shape.shape
}
```

This op need not be a refinement of the shape. In non-error cases the input
ValueShape\'s value and shape are conformant and so too for the output, but
the result may be less specified than `operand`\'s shape as `shape` is
merely used to construct the new ValueShape. If join behavior is desired
then a join op should be used.
